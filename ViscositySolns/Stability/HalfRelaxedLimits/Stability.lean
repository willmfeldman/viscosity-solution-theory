Abstract half-relaxed stability for subsolutions.

Let `ū x = upperHalfRelaxedLimit uᵢ l C x`. If the set of indices `i` for
which `uᵢ i` is a viscosity subsolution of `F = 0` on `C` belongs to `l`,
and if for every `x ∈ C` and every `J ∈ Superjet C ū x` the graph point
`((x, ū x), J)` belongs to `TailClosureSuperjetGraph C uᵢ l`, then `ū`
is a viscosity subsolution of `F = 0` on `C`. The other hypotheses are the
operator continuity and boundedness assumptions used to prove upper
semicontinuity of `ū`.

Let `u̲ x = lowerHalfRelaxedLimit uᵢ l C x`. If the set of indices `i` for

Half-relaxed stability for subsolutions.

Let `ū x = upperHalfRelaxedLimit uᵢ l C x`. If the set of indices `i` for
which `uᵢ i` is a viscosity subsolution of `F = 0` on `C` belongs to `l`,
then `ū` is a viscosity subsolution of `F = 0` on `C`, under the operator
continuity, local compactness, and boundedness hypotheses stated below.
