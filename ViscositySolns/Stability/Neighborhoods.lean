# Compact neighborhoods for local stability

This file packages compact neighborhood hypotheses used by stability arguments.

There are two levels. `CompactRelativeNeighborhood` records the compact
relative neighborhoods used directly in the paper: compact subsets `K ⊆ C`
which are neighborhoods of `x` inside `C`. `CompactLocalization` is stronger:
it adds the convexity and differentiability hypotheses consumed by the smooth
selection lemmas.

A compact relative neighborhood of `x` inside `C`.

This means that `K` is a compact subset of `C`, `x ∈ K`, and
`K ∈ nhdsWithin x C`. Equivalently, `K` contains the intersection of `C` with
some neighborhood of `x`. No convexity or ambient-interior assumption is
included.

If `K` is a relative neighborhood of `x` in `C`, then every point of `C` in
some ordinary neighborhood of `x` also has `K` as a relative neighborhood in
`C`.

Compact localizing data for a point `x` in a domain `C`.

The smooth selected-contact stability lemmas consume exactly these shape
hypotheses for the compact set `K`: compactness, convexity, unique
differentiability, and the condition that all points of `K` lie in the closure
of its interior.

The compact relative neighborhood used in the CIL proof: intersect the domain
with a positive-radius closed ball around the point. Compactness is kept as an
explicit hypothesis, as it is supplied by local compactness in the paper.

compact.

If a positive radius gives a compact intersection with a closed ball, then it
gives a compact relative neighborhood.

/--
Given any relative neighborhood `P` of `x` in `C`, local compactness lets us
choose a positive-radius closed-ball relative neighborhood contained in `P`.

The conclusion gives `r > 0`, `K = C ∩ closedBall x r`,
`CompactRelativeNeighborhood C x K`, and `K ⊆ P`. The compactness of `K` is
obtained from local compactness of the relative topology on `C` at `x`.
