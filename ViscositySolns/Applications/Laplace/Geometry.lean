# Euclidean geometry on `Point n`

`Point n = Fin n → ℝ` carries the sup norm, but the Laplace barriers are
radial for the Euclidean distance. This file records the squared Euclidean
distance `eucSq x y = (x - y) ⬝ᵥ (x - y)` and the uniform exterior sphere
condition phrased with it.

Uniform exterior sphere condition with radius `R`, in squared Euclidean
distance: every frontier point `x₀` of `C` lies on a sphere of radius `R`
centred at some `y`, and `closure C` lies outside the open ball.
