# Uniform exterior sphere condition

This file defines the uniform exterior sphere condition for a set `U` in
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`: there is a radius `R > 0` such that every boundary
point `x₀` of `U` is touched by a closed ball of radius `R` whose interior misses
`closure U`.

## Main results

* `ViscositySolns.uniformExteriorSphere_ball`: Euclidean balls satisfy the
  condition, with radius equal to their own radius.
* `ViscositySolns.UniformExteriorSphere.exists_radius_le`: the radius can be
  taken as small as desired.
* `ViscositySolns.uniformExteriorSphere_of_contDiff_levelSet`: a bounded
  sublevel set `{ρ < 0}` of a `C²` function `ρ` whose gradient does not vanish on
  the boundary satisfies the condition.

## Proof outline for level sets

On the compact boundary `‖∇ρ‖ ≥ c > 0`, and `fderiv ℝ ρ` is `Λ`-Lipschitz on a
closed ball containing the `1`-neighbourhood of `closure U`. At a boundary point
`x₀` put `y = x₀ + R • ν` with `ν = ∇ρ x₀ / ‖∇ρ x₀‖`. If `‖x - y‖ < R` then
`‖∇ρ x₀‖ ‖x - x₀‖² < 2R ⟪∇ρ x₀, x - x₀⟫`, while the first-order Taylor bound gives
`ρ x ≥ ⟪∇ρ x₀, x - x₀⟫ - Λ ‖x - x₀‖²`. For `2RΛ ≤ c` this forces `ρ x > 0`, so
`x ∉ closure U`.
