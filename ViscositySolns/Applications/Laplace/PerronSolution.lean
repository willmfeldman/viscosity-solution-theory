# The Perron solution of the Laplace Dirichlet problem

On a bounded open set `C ⊆ Point n` with `0 < n`, a Dirichlet barrier pair for
`-Δ` whose barriers are continuous on `closure C` and attain the data `g` as
boundary traces produces, through the CIL Perron theorem
`PerronMethodExistenceTheorem.strictBoundary` and the Laplace comparison
principle, a viscosity solution `w` of `-Δw = 0` on `C` that is continuous on
`closure C`, equals `g` on `frontier C`, and lies between the barriers.

Perron existence for the Laplace Dirichlet problem from continuous barriers.
The solution is continuous up to the boundary, attains `g` on `frontier C`,
and is squeezed between the barriers on `closure C`.
