Localized Jensen contact-set theorem on a closed ball.

In quantified mathematical form, this says: if `f : R^n -> R` is coordinate
semiconvex on `closedBall x0 r`, `0 < r`, and `f` has a strict local maximum
at `x0`, then for every `delta > 0`, the set of points
`x ∈ closedBall x0 r` for which there exists `p ∈ ball 0 delta` such that
`y ↦ f y + p · y` has a local maximum at `x` has positive Lebesgue measure.

The approximation principle needed to pass from the smooth Jensen theorem to
the localized Jensen contact-set theorem.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `f : R^n -> R` is coordinate
semiconvex on `closedBall x0 r`, `0 < r`, and `f x < f x0` for every
`x ∈ closedBall x0 r` with `x ≠ x0`. For every `delta > 0`, there exists a
sequence of functions `f_m : R^n -> R` and a number `c > 0` such that:

* every set `JensenContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` is measurable;
* the set-theoretic limsup
  `⋂ k, ⋃ m, ⋃ (_ : k ≤ m), JensenContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)`
  is contained in `JensenContactSet f x0 r delta`;
* for every `m`, the measure of `JensenContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` is
  at least `c`.

This is the exact nonsmooth approximation statement needed by the
measure-theoretic limsup lemma below. The smaller perturbation radius
`delta / 2` leaves room to pass perturbing vectors to a limit while remaining
inside `Metric.ball 0 delta`.

The approximation principle in the form closest to the proof in the paper.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `f : R^n -> R` is coordinate
semiconvex on `closedBall x0 r`, `0 < r`, and `f x < f x0` for every
`x ∈ closedBall x0 r` with `x ≠ x0`. For every `delta > 0`, there exists a
sequence of functions `f_m : R^n -> R` and a number `c > 0` such that:

* every set `JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` is measurable;
* the set-theoretic limsup
  `⋂ k, ⋃ m, ⋃ (_ : k ≤ m),
    JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)`
  is contained in `JensenContactSet f x0 r delta`;
* for every `m`, the measure of
  `JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` is at least `c`.

Here `JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` consists of the points in
`ball x0 r` which maximize `y ↦ f_m y + p · y` on `closedBall x0 r` for some
`p ∈ ball 0 (delta / 2)`. The use of `delta / 2` leaves a positive margin
when passing perturbing vectors to a limit.

The source-aligned global-contact approximation principle with semiconvexity
available on a larger closed ball.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `0 < r`, `r < R`, `f : R^n -> R`
is coordinate semiconvex on `closedBall x0 R`, and
`f x < f x0` for every `x ∈ closedBall x0 r` with `x ≠ x0`. For every
`delta > 0`, there exists a sequence of functions `f_m : R^n -> R` and a
number `c > 0` such that:

* every set `JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` is measurable;
* the set-theoretic limsup
  `⋂ k, ⋃ m, ⋃ (_ : k ≤ m),
    JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)`
  is contained in `JensenContactSet f x0 r delta`;
* for every `m`, the measure of
  `JensenGlobalContactSet f_m x0 r (delta / 2)` is at least `c`.

The strict inequality `r < R` is the formal version of the source proof's
choice of a smaller closed ball inside a region where the semiconvex function
is defined. It gives continuity on the boundary sphere of radius `r`.

The remaining smooth convex approximation theorem needed for the
mollification step.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `0 < r`, `r < R`, and
`g : R^n -> R` is convex on `closedBall x0 R`. Then there should be smooth
functions `g_m : R^n -> R` such that:

* for every `ε > 0`, there is a natural number `N` such that for every
  `m ≥ N` and every `z ∈ closedBall x0 r`,
  `|g_m z - g z| ≤ ε`;
* every `g_m` is twice continuously differentiable;
* every `g_m` is convex on `closedBall x0 r`.

This is the analytic mollification theorem for convex functions, stated
separately from the viscosity-solution notation. It is stronger than ordinary
smooth approximation because convexity must be preserved on the closed ball
where the Jensen contact-set estimate is applied.

Convexity on a closed ball supplies a continuous extension from an
intermediate closed ball to the whole ambient coordinate space.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `0 < r`, `r < R`, and
`g : R^n -> R` is convex on `closedBall x0 R`. Then there exists a radius
`Rmid` satisfying `r < Rmid < R` and a continuous function
`G : R^n -> R` such that `G x = g x` for every
`x ∈ closedBall x0 Rmid`.

This is the extension step used before mollification. The intermediate
radius ensures that convolution kernels with sufficiently small support do
not sample outside the region on which the original convex function is known.

The remaining convolution-only smooth approximation theorem after extending
the convex function to a continuous function on the whole space.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `0 < r`, `r < R`,
`g : R^n -> R` is convex on `closedBall x0 R`, and `G : R^n -> R` is
continuous on all of `R^n` and agrees with `g` on `closedBall x0 R`. Then
there are functions `g_m : R^n -> R` such that:

* for every `ε > 0`, there exists `N` such that for every `m ≥ N` and every
  `z ∈ closedBall x0 r`, `|g_m z - g z| ≤ ε`;
* every `g_m` is twice continuously differentiable;
* every `g_m` is convex on `closedBall x0 r`.

The intended proof is by convolution of `G` with nonnegative smooth kernels
whose supports are eventually contained in a ball of radius smaller than
`R - r`. The equality `G = g` on `closedBall x0 R` then ensures that, on
`closedBall x0 r`, the convolution only uses values where the original
function is convex.

The continuous-extension convolution theorem implies smooth convex
approximation on interior closed balls.

In quantified mathematical form, start with a convex function on
`closedBall x0 R` and choose an intermediate radius `Rmid` with
`r < Rmid < R`. The extension theorem gives a continuous function on the
ambient space agreeing with the original convex function on
`closedBall x0 Rmid`; the convolution theorem applied on the pair of radii
`r < Rmid` gives the desired smooth convex approximants on
`closedBall x0 r`.

The fixed-kernel uniform approximation estimate for normalized bump
convolution.

In quantified mathematical form, let `G : R^n -> R` be continuous and let
`φ` be a normalized smooth bump. If, for every `z ∈ closedBall x0 r`, the
oscillation of `G` on `ball z φ.rOut` is at most `ε`, then the convolution
of `G` with `φ.normed volume` differs from `G` by at most `ε` at every
`z ∈ closedBall x0 r`.

The fixed-kernel approximation estimate, rewritten for a function `g` which
agrees with the continuous extension `G` on a closed ball containing all
points sampled by the kernel.

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `G = g` on `closedBall x0 R`, every
point in `closedBall x0 r` is at distance at least `φ.rOut` from the outside
of `closedBall x0 R`, and `G` varies by at most `ε` on the balls
`ball z φ.rOut` centered at points `z ∈ closedBall x0 r`. Then the normalized
bump convolution of `G` is within `ε` of `g` on `closedBall x0 r`.

Compact uniform continuity supplies a support radius for the local

In quantified mathematical form, suppose `G = g` on `closedBall x0 R`,
